      question: "Which areas of London and Essex do you cover?",
      answer: "We are proud to offer extensive coverage across East London and parts of Essex. Our local teams are strategically based to provide reliable service to all boroughs in our service area.

    {
      question: "Are your cleaners insured, background-checked, and employed by you?",
      answer: "Yes, and we believe this is one of the most important factors in choosing a cleaning service. For your peace of mind, every member of our team is a direct employee, not a temporary contractor. They each undergo a rigorous vetting process which includes identity verification, background checks, and reference checks. Furthermore, we are fully covered by comprehensive public liability insurance, protecting your home and belongings against any accidental damage."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to provide any cleaning equipment or supplies?",
      answer: "No, you don't need to provide a thing. Our professional cleaners arrive at your property fully equipped with all the necessary high-quality equipment, from professional-grade vacuum cleaners to specialised tools. We also bring our own range of effective, safe, and eco-friendly cleaning products to ensure a perfect finish every time."
    },
    {
      question: "How does your pricing work? Is it a fixed price or an hourly rate?",
      answer: "We believe in transparent and fair pricing with no surprises. For our specialised services like End of Tenancy Cleaning and After Builders Cleaning, we provide a fixed, all-inclusive quote based on the size and condition of your property. For our regular Domestic Cleaning services, we can arrange a consistent weekly or bi-weekly rate. You will always know the full price upfront before we begin any work."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I book a recurring service, for example, weekly or fortnightly?",
      answer: "Yes, absolutely. A large number of our clients in London and Essex rely on our recurring Domestic Cleaning services to keep their homes consistently clean and fresh. We can arrange a schedule that works for you, whether it's weekly, every two weeks, or monthly. Recurring clients often benefit from a preferred time slot and a dedicated cleaner who becomes familiar with their home's specific needs."
    },
    {
      question: "What is your satisfaction guarantee?",
      answer: "We stand by the quality of our work with a rock-solid satisfaction guarantee. For our specialised services like End of Tenancy Cleaning, we offer a 72-hour re-clean guarantee. This means if your landlord or letting agent is unsatisfied with any aspect of the clean during the checkout inspection, we will return to the property and rectify it completely free of charge. Your satisfaction is our measure of success."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer specialised services beyond regular home cleaning?",
      answer: "Yes, we do. While regular domestic cleaning is a core part of our business, we are also specialists in a range of more intensive services. This includes our guaranteed End of Tenancy Cleaning for tenants moving out, After Builders Cleaning to handle post-construction dust and debris, and detailed Commercial Cleaning for offices, schools, and nurseries. You can learn more about all of our offerings on our main Services page."
